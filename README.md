Name Age App

This application was created through Udemy.com course "React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.


This application taught me how to add a Username and Age box to an application. This simple application allows the user to insert their username and age.
If the user does not enter a valid username, a modal will appear with an "Invalid input" message.
The user can use the up or down arrow keys on the right hand side of the Age box if they wish.
The bottom box will record each username entered as well as their age.


Running the attached code:

You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.
To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.
Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).
Run npm start to pull up application on your computer.
Important: You always download the entire branch content!


Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)
